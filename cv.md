## Education

**Ph.D. in Pharmacology (Computational Drug Discovery)**  
_University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada — 2020 - 2025_  
Dissertation: *“Developing Computational Methods in Proximity Pharmacology for Enzyme Discovery, PROTAC Screening, and Conformational Space Exploration”*

- **Four publications** on method and database development and two publications in pre-print.
Presented 7 talks and posters at key conferences.
- **A+ grades in world-leading post-graduate machine and deep-learning courses** at the University of Toronto, taught by Jimmy Ba and Bo Wang (CSC2515, CSC2516).
- **Performed computational structural analysis for four ongoing target specific collaborations** to better understand mechanism of action. For example:
  - Leveraged HDX mass-spectrometry data for ternary complex prediction using PROTAC screening and MD simulations.
  - Conducted docking screens and MD simulations for novel small molecules to understand binding site interactions over time.
  - Evaluated predicted protein-protein complexes using mutational data and MD simulations to identify the most stable conformation.
- **Machine learning applied to drug discovery projects**, for example:
  - Implemented a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to sample PROTAC-induced ternary complex conformational space.
  - Developed edge identification algorithm based on K-nearest neighbour graph to pick new states for advanced sampling.
  - Designed Convolutional Variational AutoEncoder (ConvVAE) to reduce the PROTAC conformational space using invariant data to visualize free energy landscape.

**B.Sc. of Science**  
_Amsterdam University College, Amsterdam, The Netherlands — 2017 - 2020_  

- **Graduated with honours (Cum Laude)**, GPA:3.88/4.0
- **Biomedical science major (Pre-med track)** with organic chemistry and pharmacology courses
- **4th year thesis project (graded 9/10)**: Computational analysis of photoswitchable sildenafil analogs as phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors
