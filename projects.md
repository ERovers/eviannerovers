## GitHub Projects

Here are a few of my public repositories:

- [KNNAS](https://github.com/erovers/kNN-AS)  
  Github repository containing general kNN-AS algorithm scripts and experiments performed for artificial landscapes and Adenylate Kinase.

- [KNNAS-PROTAC](https://github.com/erovers/knnsampling)  
  Github repository containing the kNN-AS algorithm in a pipeline where MD simulations are run with GROMACS and the conformational landscape is described by convolutional variational autoencoders. The process automatically submits jobs to the queue and keeps track of the processes. This allows for running the algorithm on scale for multiple PROTAC systems to evalute the conformational landscape with MSM models.

- [PROTAC ternary complex benchmark](https://github.com/erovers/PROTAC_ternary_complex_benchmark)  
  Github repository containing all the files for the PROTAC ternary complex prediction benchmark and instruction on how to run protocols in ICM, MOE and PRosettaC.
